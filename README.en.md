# Dream Block Resource Team

![Logo](https://i.loli.net/2019/04/13/5cb1f3939fbca.jpg)

**D**ream **B**lock **R**esource **T**eam is a resource creation team from China which created by Minecraft resource creators, enthusiasts and experienced gamers.

We created this project in order to provide a platform for feedback and advice. We can write an introduction about our team here, or we can provide a Issue platform for others to ask questions.

## How to feedback?

If you are coming to GitHub for the first time, please follow the rules below:

- Speaking in a standardized and civilized manner.
- Carefully consider whether the issue contains certain value before asking a question.
- Although this is a foreign platform, try not to discuss *sensitive* topics.

Then go to the [Issues page](https://github.com/Dream-Block/Intro/issues), click on the green "**New Issue**", and fill in the title and body. Of course, we have also prepared a template for the text so that you can fill it out.

## Can I "Fork" or "Pull Request"?

Sorry, because this is the project we use to collect user feedback, we don't support the external `pull request`. You can `fork`, but we won't accept any `pull request` requests.

## Can I join the DBRT development team?

Sorry, we are not recruiting non-Chinese members for the time being.

**Notice:**
There is no discrimination here. We won't recruit non-Chinese members because our scale is not big enough and still needs certain development. Thank you for understanding ;) 

Of course, we still welcome you to post information about us on GitHub.
